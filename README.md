# The Relation Between Terrorism and the Quality of Life

My Name is Mehmet Rafet Yıldırım, currently a sophomore Political Science and International Relations student with a Data Science and Analytics double major, and for my DSA210 term project, I want to analyze the relationship between the quality of life and terrorism around the globe, especially between 1990’s and 2010’s.

# **Overview**
The relationship between terrorism and the average quality of life might be much complex than what we expect at the first place. This project aims to reveal at least some of the underlying causes of terrorism around the globe. The ultimate goal is to predict the likelihood of an increase in terrorism in certain countries.

# **Motivation**
Living in Turkey comes with a price, and that is the anxiety of facing a terrorist attack. I always wanted to find the answer to the question of whether the life quality breeds the reasons for terrorism or terrorism is the reason that decreases the quality of life. This project will help me to understand the truth.

# **Data Sources and Collection Methods**
- The main dataset that I will focus on is the START(National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism)’s Global Terrorism Database. Firstly, I will sort all the terrorist attacks between 1990 and 2019, then I will collect the data of the number of terrorist attacks in each country. I will classify those attacks by their impact(i.e. casualties), this will help me to have a better understanding of countries’ states in terms of terrorism.

- I will use the HDI(Human Development Index) dataset in order to be able to understand which countries have better overall life quality.

# **Hypothesis**

- Null Hypothesis 1: Prevalence of terrorist attacks negatively affects the Human Development in countries.
- Alternative Hypothesis 1: There is no correlation between the number of terrorist attacks and the Human Development Index.
- Null hypothesis 2: The severity of terrorist attacks negatively affects the Human Development Index in various countries.
- Alternative Hypothesis 2: The severity of terrorist attacks does not affect the Human Development Index.
