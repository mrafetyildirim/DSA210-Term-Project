# The Relation Between Terrorism and the Quality of Life

My Name is Mehmet Rafet Yıldırım, currently a sophomore Political Science and International Relations student with a Data Science and Analytics double major, and for my DSA210 term project I want to analyze the relationship between the quality of life and terrorism around the globe, especially between 1990’s and 2010’s.

Overview:
The relationship between terrorism and the average quality of life might be much complex than what we expect at the first place. This project aims to reveal at least some of the underlying causes of terrorism around the globe. The ultimate goal is to predict the likelihood of increase in terrorism in certain countries.

Motivation:
Living in Turkey comes with a price, and that is the anxiety of facing with a terrorist attack. I always wanted to find the answe to the question of whether the life quality breeds the reasons of terrorism or the terrorism is the reason that decreases the quality of life. This project will help me to understand the truth.

Datasets:
The main dataset that i will focus on is the START(National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism)’s Global Terrorism Database. Firstly, I will sort all the terrorist attacks between 1990 and 2019, then I will collect the data of the number of terrorist attacks in each country. I will classify those attacks as their impact(i.e. casualties), this will help me to have a better understanding of countries’ states in terms of terrorism.

I will use two different datasets to analyze the relationship between terrorism and the quality of life. Those datasets will help me to understand the states of freedom/development in countries.

P.S. I did not have time to upload datasets to my github compository since I couldn’t finish sorting the data.
