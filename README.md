# The Relation Between Terrorism and the Quality of Life

Overview
This term project is designed to give you hands-on experience applying the data science concepts and techniques learned throughout the semester to a real-world problem. You will work through the entire data science pipeline: from data collection and cleaning to analysis, visualization, and presentation of insights.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:
●	Apply data science methodologies to solve a practical problem
●	Develop skills in data collection, preparation, and analysis
●	Implement appropriate statistical and machine learning techniques
●	Create effective data visualizations
●	Communicate findings through written reports and presentations
●	Practice ethical considerations in data science

Concept
●	In the project, every student is expected to work alone. 
●	You can either work with a data set of your own (e.g. your fitness data, reddit usages, etc.), or a publicly available data. If you opt to work with publicly available data, you are expected to enrich it by another set of data. For example, if you work with stock market price data, you can create indices or add other financial/economic indicators.
●	VRL Lab offers the following public datasets and if you are interested in research about computational social science, you can conduct a project with them.
o	Twitter dataset for #Secim2023 project
o	Diplomatic text dataset from GlobalDiplomacyNet project
●	Some topics, Spotify data, step count data, are NOT allowed. 

What to present
●	Motivation: Why are you working on this project?
●	Data source: Where did you get this data? How did you collect it? 
●	Data analysis: Techniques used, different stages of the analysis 
●	Findings: What are the interesting findings that you found in this project? 
●	Limitations and future work: What could be done better? Do you have any future plans about your project?

Note: the presentation can be either a classical article type report, a video, webpage for the project, etc. You can prefer any of these. 




Timeline
●	31 October: Submit the project proposal in a Github URL with README.md.  In the README.md file, please outline the project proposal, the data that you would be using, and your plans on how to collect it. 
●	28 November: Collect the data, conduct exploratory data analysis methods and hypothesis tests on the data
●	02 January: Apply ML methods on the dataset
●	09 January until 23:59: Final submission

Note: All submissions will be through Github. After you submit the Github links, we will be then following your progress through Github. So do not change the link. Also, we expect you to do Github commits regularly. 

Note: Every student will be assigned to an assistant, and is expected to get help from the assistant. 

Code Requirements
●	All code must be written in Python
●	Code must be well-documented with comments
●	Include a requirements.txt file for Python dependencies
●	Submit a GitHub repository link containing all code and documentation
●	Include a README.md with instructions to reproduce your analysis

Evaluation
There will be three aspects for grading: 1) originality (how original is your project idea), 2) quality (how best you applied the relevant methods to analyze your data), 3) presentation (how well the presentation is). We will also consider peer-evaluation, that each student will be asked to grade their own work and a selected set of other students’.

Academic Integrity
All sources must be properly cited. Your submitted work must be original and completed by yourself. Use of AI tools (e.g. LLMs) is permitted but must be explicitly documented, including specific prompts used and outputs generated. Failure to disclose AI assistance will be considered academic dishonesty.
